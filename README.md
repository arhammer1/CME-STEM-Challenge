<h2> Introduction</h2>
Hi, 

We are a group of high school students hailing from the city of Chicago. We are representing Lane Tech College Prep High School, a selective enrollment school with a rich history and a fantastic computer science program. We are apart of Robert Berg's Intro into Artificial Intelligence class and we are grateful to have worked with our mentor in the this STEM Challenge. The application we created is meant to predict futures prices by analyzing a snapshot of historical market data. It uses a forked version of Backtrader, a free python back testing library, along with pytrends, an api for gathering google search trend data.
